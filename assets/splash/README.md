Place your splash screen logo here.

## Requirements

- **Filename**: `logo.png`
- **Recommended size**: 512x512 pixels or larger

## How to add your logo

1. Create or prepare your app logo (PNG format recommended)
2. Resize it to 512x512 pixels (or maintain aspect ratio)
3. Save it as `logo.png` in this folder
4. Update `assets/config.yaml` if you want to use a different filename

## Fallback

If no logo is provided, the app will display a default icon as fallback.
